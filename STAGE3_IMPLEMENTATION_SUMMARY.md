## 🎯 Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Intent-Aware Processing
The system intelligently detects query intent and adapts responses accordingly:
- **Definition queries**: "What is machine learning?"
- **Explanation queries**: "How does deep learning work?"
- **Comparison queries**: "Compare CNN vs RNN"
- **How-to queries**: "How to implement a neural network?"
- **Summarization queries**: "Summarize key ML concepts"

### 2. Context-Aware Generation
Responses are generated considering:
- Retrieved document context
- Query intent and entities
- User's specific information needs
- Quality requirements

### 3. Multi-Dimensional Quality Assessment
Every response is evaluated on:
- **Relevance**: How well it addresses the query
- **Coherence**: Internal consistency and flow
- **Completeness**: Thoroughness of the answer
- **Technical Quality**: Length, repetition, structure

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Basic Pipeline Usage
```python
from rag_papers.generation import QueryProcessor, RAGGenerator, ResponseVerifier

# Initialize components
processor = QueryProcessor()
generator = RAGGenerator()
verifier = ResponseVerifier()

# Process query
processed = processor.preprocess_query("What is machine learning?")

# Generate response
response = generator.generate_answer(context, query, processed)

# Verify quality
quality = verifier.verify_response(response.text, query, context)
```

### Complete Workflow
```python
# See demo_rag_pipeline.py for comprehensive examples
python demo_rag_pipeline.py
